//        if we call the print function without any parameters first function will executed

//        String s = a.print("shiva");
//        now the print function with string will be executed
//        we already which will be triggered at compilation time only thats why it is compilation polymorphism

//        method overloading happens when there are two or more methods with same name and same return type(signature)

//        you cannot have two methods where their only difference is return type this is not allowed
